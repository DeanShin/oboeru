Japanese Flashcards

A program that utilizes bootstrap, flask, and the [tatoeba database](https://tatoeba.org/eng/downloads) in order to create interactive Japanese flashcards.

Currently, the program selects a random sentence from the tatoeba database then generates a flashcard from the grammatical items present within the sentence. However, this may be subject to change, as randomly chosen grammar items may not be as intuitive for learning purposes.
